## Dataset

We will be using the [Japanese Manga Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandlertimm/unified) sourced by CHANDLER TIMM DOLORIEL on `Kaggle`.

To download and setup this dataset, please create a `Kaggle` API token (you must also register for an account if you do not have one). You should get a `kaggle.json` file which contains your `Kaggle` API credentials. Run `get_dataset.py`, and the terminal should prompt you to enter your username and API token. This download will take a few minutes...
